# Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts whether an employee will leave the company using supervised learning techniques. It uses an HR dataset and compares three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

## Goal
Reduce turnover by identifying high-risk employees using interpretable ML.

## Dataset
- Features: Education, Experience, Payment Tier, Gender, Age, etc.
- Target: LeaveOrNot (0 or 1)
- Source: Kaggle

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Best performing model: Random Forest Classifier
